Mini C++ OOP Test Project
This is a simple test project I created to learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of the fundamentals of C++ and how to apply OOP concepts to real-world problems.

Project Overview
This project consists of a basic implementation of a Developer and Teacher class, which inherit from a base Employee class. The project demonstrates the use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in C++.

What I Learned
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the following C++ concepts:

Inheritance and polymorphism
Encapsulation and abstraction
Virtual functions and function overriding
Basic C++ syntax and data types
Code Structure
The project consists of the following files:

Employee.h and Employee.cpp: Define the base Employee class
Developer.h and Developer.cpp: Define the Developer class, which inherits from Employee
Teacher.h and Teacher.cpp: Define the Teacher class, which inherits from Employee
main.cpp: Demonstrates the use of the Developer and Teacher classes
